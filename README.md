# Tours
The structures of "useEffect" and "Conditional Rendering" are used in this project. When you "Not Interested" button clicks on the tours that were listed, the tour removes from the list. If you "Read More" button clicks, all description is shown. When all tours are removed from the list, the "Refresh" button appears on the screen. When this button was clicked the tour list loads again.
